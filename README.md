# CBM_high_temperature_concrete_compressive_strength

This repository contains the dataset we collect for our JCBM paper "A convolution-based deep learning approach for estimating compressive strength of fiber reinforced concrete at elevated temperatures".

If you use our dataset or our code, please cite our paper. 

Note that in the "data" directory, we include our dataset named "data.csv", and also a widely-used concrete strength dataset named "Dataset2.csv". Please refer to our paper for more details about these two datasets.

The code is tested with the following dependencies:
- Python 3.7.*
- Keras 2.*

You can follow the following commands to run our code:

- python main_cnn.py

If any problems, please contact xinhong.chen@my.cityu.edu.hk
